    <p>Hey everyone, I am from Utah and live 25 minutes outside of Salt Lake City. I have been married to my wife for 6 years and we have two beautiful kids that wear us out. My daughter is two and a half years old and my son is five months old.</p>
    <p>I am working towards my degree in Business Management with a focus on Entrepreneurship. I plan to start some businesses that can make an impact in the world and within my own home. Family, like many of you, is the most important thing to me and I want to be able to be there for my kids whenever they need me. I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to learn and finish a degree that is applicable to what I am hoping to achieve in my life. After obtaining my Bachelors degree I will most likely pursue a Masters degree.</p>
    <p>I currently work as a personal trainer, training out of my garage. I have been a trainer for 5 years working for 24 hour fitness as the fitness manager and then branching out onto my own training out of a local gym. Now I don't even have to leave my own property and I get to do what I love and spend time with my kids. My wife works as a Registered Dietian and works from home. Majority of our conversations are about health and wellness and our kids. We are working on a blog that will focus on family health within the home.</p>
    <p>When it comes to running my own business the knowledge I will gain from this class with be a huge help. I love being able to learn of things of this world while also learning the gospel and seeing how they go hand-in-hand. I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints my whole life but was only active for half of it. I am happy to be back in the fold and recieve all the blessing Heavenly Father has in store for me.</p>
