        Families are the most important unit there is. They laugh together, they cry together, and they create memories together so why not get healthy together? When striving to be healthy it can be difficult to navigate all the information that there is out there. We offer comprehensive programs personalized for your family covering both nutrition and exercise. We make sense of all the confusion, and we meet you in the middle.
        Not only is the family the most important unit there is, but they can also be a source of strength when overcoming unhealthy habits. Take your family’s health seriously so you can continue to create happy memories together for many years to come. Don’t let fatigue and poor health stop you from being the best father, mother, daughter, son, or grandparent there is.
        We want to create healthy habits that carry on through generations and help to provide a long life for everyone in the family.

      <h3>Food & Nutrition</h3>
      <p>
        Food is a joy and burden. Whether we like it or not, we need to eat to survive but if we eat too much or not get the right nutrients then it can have adverse effects. So, what should you eat? Is there anything you should stay away from? How much is too much? These questions and many more are ones that people ask themselves every day. Food means more than just taste, it means culture, family, friendships, gatherings, memories, and it is our source of energy and life.
        Programs are offered for any size of family, even if it is a family of two. It is difficult to eat differently than your family when trying to be healthy. It can be lonely and miserable, that’s why we approach health goals as a family effort and not an individual effort. You know the saying, “you can’t have your cake and eat it too” in this case you can. You can achieve your health goals and still have that cake!
        Education about Macronutrients and Micronutrients will be provided. We do not offer written out meal plans because every family is different, and we want you to be true to who you are and what you enjoy so we work together to help you plan your meals and make age-old family recipes healthy! We provide handouts, educational materials, and much more.

      <h3>Exercise & Fitness</h3>
      <p>
        Often when we think about exercise and fitness we think about the gym and having a six-pack. What if I told you that there is a different meaning? The Oxford Dictionary defines exercise as, “activity requiring physical effort, carried out to sustain or improve health and fitness” and fitness as, “the condition of being physically fit and healthy”. Neither of these definitions mention the gym or how the body looks. The key word in both definitions is ‘Health’. We exercise to be healthy. That sparks the question, how do we exercise? Many families bond over different hobbies and activities like puzzles, a television series, snowboarding, playing basketball, hiking, and many more. Exercise isn’t about lifting heavy weights, although resistance training is an important aspect of exercise which we will dive into later. Exercising is about creating movement and effort. For some, exercise might look like going for a simple walk around the block, for others it may be going for a long hike what ever your starting point is make sure it is yours and not what you think other people expect it to be. 
        Exercising can be an individual activity, a couple activity, a family activity, or a mix of all of them. Each member of the family may have different goals and starting points. What is important is that you support and encourage each other in those goals. Our programs will help give you ideas of different activities you can do as a family and teach you how to have fun. Each fitness program is created specifically for you and your family. Just like our nutrition programs, you will be provided with educational materials that will help you achieve your goals.

      <p>         
        The home page is an introduction to the website that includes our purpose.

      <h3>Food and Nutrition</h3>
      <p>         
        Small icons may go with each paragraph. Each paragraph is seperate from each other with different information. There will also be a button included in the top image.

        Like the food and nutrition page there will be a button in the heading that would lead to an appointment scheduler.
