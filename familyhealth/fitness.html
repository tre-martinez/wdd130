        <h2>What is exercise?</h2>
        <p>Often when we think about exercise and fitness we think about the gym and having a six-pack. What if I told you that there is a different meaning? The Oxford Dictionary defines exercise as, “activity requiring physical effort, carried out to sustain or improve health and fitness” and fitness as, “the condition of being physically fit and healthy”. Neither of these definitions mention the gym or how the body looks. The key word in both definitions is ‘Health’. We exercise to be healthy. </p>

        <h2>Types of exercise</h2>
        <p>That sparks the question, how do we exercise? Many families bond over different hobbies and activities like puzzles, a television series, snowboarding, playing basketball, hiking, and many more. Exercise isn’t about lifting heavy weights, although resistance training is an important aspect of exercise which we will dive into later. Exercising is about creating movement and effort. For some, exercise might look like going for a simple walk around the block, for others it may be going for a long hike what ever your starting point is make sure it is yours and not what you think other people expect it to be. Exercising can be an individual activity, a couple activity, a family activity, or a mix of all of them.</p>

        <h2>Program Structure</h2>
        <p>Each member of the family may have different goals and starting points. What is important is that you support and encourage each other in those goals. Our programs will help give you ideas of different activities you can do as a family and teach you how to have fun. Each fitness program is created specifically for you and your family. Just like our nutrition programs, you will be provided with educational materials that will help you achieve your goals.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>The goals we will set won't always be weight related. We may set hiking goals, sports goals, daily habit goals, and many more. Your motivation will be your own desire and determination.</p>
