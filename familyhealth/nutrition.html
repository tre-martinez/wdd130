        <div class="common"><h2>Common Questions</h2>
        <p>Food can be both a joy and a burden. Whether we like it or not, we need to eat to survive but if we eat too much or not get the right nutrients then it can have adverse effects. So, what should you eat? Is there anything you should stay away from? How much is too much? These questions and many more are ones that people ask themselves every day.</p></div>
        <div class="food"><h2>Food Is More Than Calories</h2> 
        <p>Food means more than just taste, it means culture, family, friendships, gatherings, memories, and it is our source of energy and life.</p> </div>
        <div class="who"><h2>Who are the programs for?</h2>
        <p>Programs are offered for any size of family, even if it is a family of two.It is difficult to eat differently than your family when trying to be healthy. It can be lonely and miserable, that’s why we approach health goals as a family effort and not an individual effort. </p></div>
        <div class="program"><h2>Program Structure</h2>
        <p>You know the saying, “you cant have your cake and eat it too” in this case you can. You can achieve your health goals and still have that cake! Education about Macronutrients and Micronutrients will be provided. We do not offer written out meal plans because every family is different, and we want you to be true to who you are and what you enjoy so we work together to help you plan your meals and make age-old family recipes healthy! We provide handouts, educational materials, and much more.</p></div>
